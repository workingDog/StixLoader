## An App to load STIX-2.0 objects

**StixLoader** is a desktop application that loads [STIX-2.0](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/) 
objects from various source storage systems to destination output systems. The aim of **StixLoader** is to convert STIX-2
domain objects (SDO) and relationships (SRO) from and to; files, MongoDB, Neo4j and PostgreSQL. 
**StixLoader** runs on the Java Virtual Machine and provides a graphical user interface 
for choosing the STIX-2 data source and destination systems.
    
### Installation and packaging
Download this repo, and install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). 

To compile the source code and assemble the application and all its dependencies into a single fat jar file, use [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) and type:

    sbt assembly

This will produce a big jar file called *stixloader-1.0.jar* in the *./target/scala-2.12* directory. 
    
### Usage

Using [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) directly (without having to generate a jar file) type:

    sbt run
 
Using Java to launch **StixLoader**, type at a command prompt:
 
    java -jar stixloader-1.0.jar

Or in most systems, double click on the *stixloader-1.0.jar* file.

This will display the main user interface of the application.

Select the data source from the **From** list, then select a destination from the **To** list.
**StixLoader** will convert and load the data as per the selections when the **Convert** button is clicked. 
Some basic chronological log information can be read in the *Log info* tab.

Selecting *File* will popup a file dialog to choose the file to convert to or from. The file types can be 
a file (.json or .stix) containing a STIX-2 bundle in json format, 
or a zip file containing one or more bundle files, i.e. with extension .json or .stix, all other files types 
are ignored. 

Selecting *MongoDB* will try to connect to a *MongoDB* server. If no server is running a message 
to that effect will be displayed at the bottom of the App. Ensure that the *MongoDB* server has 
 finished connecting before clicking on the *Convert* button.

Selecting *Neo4j* will pop-up a dialog to choose the Neo4j database directory to load the data to. 
Currently *Neo4j* can only be selected as a destination.  

Selecting *PostgreSQL* is not yet implemented. 

The selection of one data source or destination disables the opposite system. For example; 
if *MongoDB* is selected in the *From* section, the *MongoDB* is deselected in the *To* section.

To deselect a currently selected item, simply click on it again. If the selection pops-up a dialog, 
for example when choosing *File*, select *Cancel* and the selection will be removed.

The *application.conf* file in the resource directory contains settings for the MongoDB server 
and Neo4j default database directory. Adjust these entries to suit your system.

Note: a full debugging log can be found in the *application.log* file in the *logs* directory. 
To tune the loggin process, edit the *logback.xml* file.

An large STIX-2 dataset can be found from MITRE 
[Cyber Threat Intelligence Repository expressed in STIX 2.0](https://github.com/mitre/cti).
Download the whole github repository as a **.zip** file, then select this **cti-master.zip** 
as the source **File** and **Neo4j** as the destination. Launch the **Neo4j app** and select the Neo4j directory as the database location and click start. 
Once the status is "started", open a browser on "http://localhost:7474". The data can then displayed as a graph.

### Dependencies and requirements

Depends specifically on the [ScalaStix](https://github.com/workingDog/scalastix) and 
[StixToNeoLib](https://github.com/workingDog/StixToNeoLib).

See also the *build.sbt* file.

Java 8 is required.
